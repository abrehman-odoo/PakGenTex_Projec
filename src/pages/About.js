        <h5>Need of Building Pakistan Gender Text (PakGenText)</h5>
          <p>Human language is not static and uniform; but keeps on evolving with the passage of time. In consequence, language variation gradually develops due to a number of social variables. One of the most significant social variables is gender. Gender plays a significant role in generating language variation between men and women. In Pakistan, no such corpus has been developed so far which can distinctly focus on the language used by men and women. There is a dire need to develop a corpus by employing modern methods to develop and maintain corpus. So, this research project aims to develop a corpus (PakGenText) which will not only distinguish the use of language in different genre but also focuses on gender based language use in different genre. This corpus may also be used in various research paradigms like Gender Studies, Education, Sociology, Psychology, inter-Cultural Communication, Linguistics, Literature, English Language Teaching etc.  To meet the international criteria of education and research, this project will pave its ways in building positive international image of Pakistan in academic discourse community and professional industry. Keeping in view the modern trends and needs of learners, this research focused on the practical implications of online corpora for ELT and its utility in the Pakistani context (Zahra & Abbas, 2018). At international level, teams of professionals and experts are working in building corpora like British National Corpus, American National Corpus, and Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English. Some of them are updated on monthly basis.</p>
